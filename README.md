## 🛠️ Features

### ✅ `sales_app.py`
- Built using **Streamlit**
- Interactive filters: City, Customer Type, Gender
- Visuals:
  - Pie chart of product line sales
  - Line graph of sales by hour
- Real-time KPI metrics:
  - Total Sales
  - Total Transactions
  - Average Sale/Transaction
  - Average Rating
  - Total Unique Customers

### ✅ `sales_mapreduce.py`
- Loads Excel data
- Uses MapReduce logic to:
  - Map: Extract relevant sales, product, and customer data
  - Reduce: Compute KPIs
  - Write product sales to `product_sales.txt` for dashboard use

---

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- pandas
- matplotlib
- openpyxl

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install streamlit pandas matplotlib openpyxl
````

---

## 🚀 How to Run

### 🖥️ 1. Run the MapReduce Script (Generate KPI Data)

```bash
python sales_mapreduce.py
```

### 📊 2. Launch the Dashboard

```bash
streamlit run sales_app.py
```

Make sure `sales_data.xlsx` is in the same directory and contains a `Sales` sheet with the required columns.

---

## 📌 Notes

* Ensure the Excel file has all necessary columns:

  * `Invoice ID`, `City`, `Customer_type`, `Gender`, `Product line`, `Total`, `Time`, `Rating`, etc.
* `product_sales.txt` is generated by `sales_mapreduce.py` and read by `sales_app.py`.
